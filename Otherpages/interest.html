		<li>Swimming: One of my favourite sports is swimming. Ever since my childhood I have enjoyed swimming so much that I always participated in swimming competitions. Until this day swimming is on my number one list every time I want to go and relax. </li>

	<li><b>Volunteer Work/Community Involvement:</b> In addition to being a businessman, my father has also instilled in me the value of helping one’s community.  His businesses have helped to create jobs and help local members of the community generate an income. This spirit of philanthropy inspired me to join my high school’s charity club, where I worked to raise money for various local causes including a charity drive benefiting underprivileged youth within Addis Ababa.</li>

	<li><b>Club Memberships:</b> Newspaper club, Charity club, Music and Basketball club, Social Concern club, Environment club and anti- AIDS club, 2014-2018</li>

	<li><b>Art- music(listening):</b> I love music! It's a way to get me off so many things. When stressed, happy or in any other feeling music always helps. Usually I like listening to hip hop, reggae and  pop music </li>

	<li><b>Reading:</b> I would like to say that it's one of the best things. Especially fictions, they take you into a new world, a world where you're imagination works at its best as you try to see things in you're own mind. One of the best books I've read this year was 'Born in crime' by Trevor Noah. It's a non - fiction book which talks about him and his family during the apartheid in South Africa. </li>
